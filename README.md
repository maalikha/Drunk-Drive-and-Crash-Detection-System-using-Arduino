Arduino-based vehicle safety system
The Smart In-Vehicle Safety Detection and Alert System is a compact, low-cost solution designed to improve road safety by detecting alcohol consumption and vehicle collisions. Using an Arduino Uno, MQ3 alcohol sensor, ADXL335 accelerometer, GSM Module 900A, and other components, the system continuously monitors the driver’s alcohol level and any abnormal movements indicating a crash. If alcohol is detected beyond a safe threshold, or if an impact is sensed, the system simulates engine shutdown using a DC motor and fan, activates a buzzer and red LED, displays the warning on a 16x2 I2C LCD, and sends an SMS alert to a predefined emergency contact in both cases. It can also detect the direction of impact—front, back, left, or right—using accelerometer data, which is also displayed and included in the alert. A green LED indicates safe conditions, while a red LED and buzzer signal danger. The system resets automatically after five seconds if the threat is no longer present, ensuring continuous monitoring. Stable power is supplied to the Arduino and GSM through buck converters, making the system reliable and scalable for real-world use.
